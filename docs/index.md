*Meow Meow*, an intelligent pet interaction system, allows you to remotely
monitor the temperature and humidity condition, control the light and fan and
on top of that, interact with your pets. We use two *Tessel 2* boards to build
up the environment monitoring system and the interactive feeding system (one
board for each system).

**Features**

- Stream real-time video
- Monitor temperature and humidity
- Call your pets (with prerecorded audio)
- Receive calls from your pets (press the button and call)
- Feed your pets with automatic food dispenser (remotely controllable)
- Provide web user interface
